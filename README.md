# A script to calculate even spacing
A python script for even placing of objects like fence posts or ceiling lights

## Usage:
lets say for example you want to place fence posts on a fence that is x blocks long, in this example 43 blocks.
* you input the desired length into the program

  * we will explore what unchecking that box does soon
* once you press "Calculate Placements, you will get all the possible options.
  if for that length no options exist, try removing or adding two blocks. you can make it work!

* I don't have minecraft open right now so I will just use letters in Notepad++ as an example.
* I will go for option five as it fits the amount of objects I want.

* That looks good doesn't it?

* Now lets see what that checkbox is for

* If you untick the checkbox, it will start with a space instead of an object. This is useful for ceiling lights and the like where having them on the edges would look weird.
* This time I will use option 2
